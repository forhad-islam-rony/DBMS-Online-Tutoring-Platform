## Importance of the Database in the Online Tutoring Platform

A robust and well-structured database lies at the heart of the Online Tutoring Platform, serving as the cornerstone of its functionality. It acts as a repository for user data, course information, session schedules, and feedback records. This centralized database enables efficient data management, ensuring that tutors and students can access relevant information swiftly and securely. In essence, it forms the backbone of the platform, facilitating smooth operation and enhancing the overall user experience.

## Project Objectives

The Online Tutoring Platform project aims to achieve several key objectives essential for effective online education:

1. **Design a Relational Database Schema**
   - Create a comprehensive database schema to organize and manage data related to online tutoring.
   - Include data for users, courses, sessions, reviews, payments, and tutor courses.

2. **Implement SQL Queries**
   - Develop SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval within the database.
   - Enable functionalities such as creating new courses, scheduling sessions, managing user information, processing payments, and assigning tutors to courses.

## Database Design

### Overview of the Database Schema:

The Online Tutoring Platform database is structured around key tables designed to encompass all necessary data for online education. The main tables include:

- **Users**: Stores information about users, including user ID, full name, email, password, and role (student or teacher).
- **Courses**: Contains data about courses offered on the platform, including course ID, course name, description, and instructor ID.
- **Sessions**: Records details about tutoring sessions, including session ID, tutor ID, student ID, course ID, session date and time, duration, and status.
- **Reviews**: Manages reviews and ratings given by students for sessions, including review ID, session ID, rating, and comments.
- **Payments**: Tracks payment transactions for sessions, including payment ID, session ID, amount, payment date and time, and payment status.
- **TutorCourses**: Assigns tutors to courses, including tutor ID, course ID, and experience years. This table helps manage the relationship between tutors and the courses they teach.

## Rationale Behind the Design Decisions

The design of the database schema was driven by the need to effectively organize and easily access data related to online tutoring. Each table was created to manage specific types of information related to tutoring activities, ensuring that the database could handle various queriesâ€”from user profiles and course details to session scheduling and payment tracking.

### Table Relationships:

The relationships between the tables are established using foreign keys, which ensure that data is linked correctly and maintains integrity. For example, the sessions table has foreign keys referencing the users table to connect tutors and students to their respective sessions.

### Normalization:

Normalization techniques were applied to ensure that the database is structured efficiently and avoids redundancy. This helps in maintaining consistency across data and prevents any issues with updating information. By organizing data up to the third normal form (3NF), the database remains manageable, scalable, and optimized for performance.
